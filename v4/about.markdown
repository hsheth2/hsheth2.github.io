I'm Harshal Sheth, and I'm an undergrad studying CS at Yale. I've previously worked at Google, where I built out tracing tools for the Fuchsia OS, and at Instabase, where I built a scalable, distributed task execution framework.

At Yale, I'm involved in a bunch of different things: I dance with [MonstRAASity](https://collegearts.yale.edu/organizations/alliance-dance-yale/dance-groups/monstraasity-raas), advise tech teams as part of [Code4Good](http://yalecode4good.org/), help manage a $400k portfolio in [YSIG](https://yalesig.com/), and analyze investment opportunities for the greater good through [UP Fund](https://www.theupfund.org/about). I also started and run the [YCS](http://yalecompsociety.org/) Dev Team, which manages [Coursetable](https://coursetable.com/). 

Right now, I've been working on some [personal projects]({% link projects.markdown %}), and I'll be starting at Citadel Securities in a few weeks.
