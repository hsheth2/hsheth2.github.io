I've worked on a bunch of different things over the years. 
Although I'm always [working on new stuff](https://github.com/hsheth2), this should serve as a mostly complete compilation.

## Major Projects

### **Skua**: distributed tracing in the Linux kernel 

![Skua architecture]({{site.url}}/assets/images/skua-diagram.png)

Skua extends the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/ ) distributed tracing framework to integrate kernel-level traces produced by [LTTng](https://lttng.org/ ).
[Andrew Sun](https://andrewsun.com/) and I presented at the [2018 MIT PRIMES conference](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/conference/conf-2018.php) and at [DevConf US 2018](https://devconf.info/us/2018).

- Take a look at our [slides](https://l.sheth.io/skua-slides).
- Watch the [video](https://youtu.be/vyCU8D5KYek?t=1h7m7s) of our presentation.
- Our [code](https://github.com/docc-lab/skua) is open source - try it out! 

### **Tarpan**: a routing protocol design to replace BGP

Tarpan is a completely in-band variant of the [D-BGP](https://www.darwinsbgp.com/) protocol. D-BGP, designed by our research mentor [Raja Sambasivan](https://www.rajasambasivan.com/), contains all the necessary characteristics to move the Internet away from the Border Gateway Protocol and its limitations, while maintaining backwards compatibility to facilitate incremental adoption. [Andrew Sun](https://andrewsun.com/) and I presented at the [2017 MIT PRIMES conference](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/conference/conf-2017.php) and were also named semifinalists in the 2017 [Siemens Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Competition).

- Look at our [slides](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2017/conf/12-1-Sheth-Sun.pdf)
- Read the [paper](https://l.sheth.io/tarpan).
- We implemented Tarpan as an [extension](https://github.com/hsheth2/tarpan/compare/aa93417671b609a56997bc2c676cbfc640199e7a...master) to the [Quagga router](https://www.quagga.net/). Take a look at our [code](https://github.com/hsheth2/tarpan).

### **GoNet**: a TCP/IP network stack in Go

[Aashish Welling](https://github.com/omegablitz) and I implemented a user-space network stack in Go. We presented at the [2015 MIT PRIMES conference](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/conference/conf-2015.php) and were also named semifinalists in the 2015 [Siemens Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Competition).

- Read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05636), titled *An Implementation and Analysis of a Kernel Network Stack in Go with the CSP Style*.
- Our [code](https://github.com/hsheth2/gonet) is open source and probably has more Github stars than it deserves.

### **when2water**: an intelligent irrigation controller

Along with my brother [Nihar Sheth](https://nihar.sheth.io), I built a low-cost irrigation controller that uses machine learning and local weather data to reduce water usage by almost 60%. We then built a website and API, and even installed a couple irrigation controllers in people's homes in our community. We were one of 31 teams to win the $1k local award prize as part of the [Google Science Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Science_Fair), and were also named [state winners](https://www.newea.org/2015/07/01/wef-announces-sjwp-2015-winner-and-finalists/) in the [Stockholm Junior Water Prize](https://www.wef.org/resources/for-the-public/SJWP/).

- Try it out on our [website](https://when2water.org/).
- News articles in the [Westford Eagle](https://westford.wickedlocal.com/article/20140808/news/140807176) and [Lowell Sun](https://www.lowellsun.com/2015/07/18/award-winning-westford-brothers-devise-program-to-conserve-water/).
- Our [code](https://github.com/when2water/when2water) is hosted on Github.

### CTFs

While not really a project per-se, I've spent a fair amount of time on [Capture The Flag](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) competitions, a type of information security competition. I've had the pleasure of working with some really bright people over a bunch of different competitions, including CSAW HSF, picoCTF, TJCTF, HSCTF, and PACTF.

This all culminated in us running our own competition, [CTF(x)](https://ctf-x.github.io/). Almost [500 teams](https://ctftime.org/event/348) participated in the CTF, and no team was able to get a perfect score. After the competition, we posted detailed  [writeups](https://github.com/ctf-x/ctfx-problems-2016) for all the problems.

## Hackathon Projects

I've competed in a bunch of different hackathons. The code that we write during hackathons isn't pretty, and may require [minimal configuration and tweaking](https://xkcd.com/1742/) to get working.
