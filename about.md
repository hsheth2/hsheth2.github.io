I'm Harshal Sheth, and I'm an undergrad studying CS at Yale. I'm also a founding engineer at [Acryl Data](https://www.acryldata.io/).

I've previously interned at the following places:

- [8VC](https://8vc.com/), where I worked on the investments team to evaluate startups.
- Citadel Securities, where I worked with the Advanced Technologies Group on low-latency tech.
- Google, where I built out tracing tools for [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/).
- [Instabase](https://about.instabase.com/), where I built a scalable, distributed task execution framework.

<!-- At Yale, I'm involved in a bunch of different things: I dance on [MonstRAASity](https://collegearts.yale.edu/organizations/alliance-dance-yale/dance-groups/monstraasity-raas), advise tech teams as part of [Code4Good](http://yalecode4good.org/), help manage a $400k portfolio in [YSIG](https://yalesig.com/), and analyze investment opportunities for the greater good through [UP Fund](https://www.theupfund.org/about). I also started and run the [YCS](http://yalecompsociety.org/) Dev Team, which manages [CourseTable](https://coursetable.com/). -->

Right now (as of 2022-01-18), I'm finishing up my last semester at Yale and working on a few [side projects]({% link projects.md %}).
